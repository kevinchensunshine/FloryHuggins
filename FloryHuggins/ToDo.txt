# This folder is for Polymer phase separation, Flory-Huggins theory

To Do:
1. Develop solid understanding of FH theory (Rubinstein & Colby, Polymer Physics, Chapter 4), maybe even write a small summary
2. Review code in python to see solvers needed (FloryHuggins.ipynb)
3. Develop a sense for needed components/layout/infrastructure
4. Review examples of online apps to refine 3.
